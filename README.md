A couple of scripts that deploys a basic ASP.NET application to Azure cloud using ARM templates.


# Requiremens

* GH CLI
* JQ
* Bash

# Deploy

Deploy it by either using 'deploy_provision_arm.sh' or 'simple_deploy_provision_arm.sh'
The simpler version requires you to hardcode values such as github username and repository.
The non-simple version will allow you to either hardcode it, or asks you in the terminal. It will also exit at numerous points if the inputs are invalid.

# Feedback
Feedback is welcome.

Thanks.
